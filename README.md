### M. Merritt Smith's Personal Blog

Welcome to my blog. I write about quantitative and ocmputational approaches to social science, public policy, data science, weightlifting, economics, the NBA, chess, philosophy, carpentry, data visualization, bicycles, politics, and anything else that I'm interested in or study. Sorry for the mess.

Thanks to <a href = 'https://github.com/clayh53'>Clay Harmon</a> for creating the Tufte-Jekyll theme.
